## Why was my issue closed?
**If your issue was closed, it could be one of 3 things:**

  **1. Your issue is intentional.** Though it happens very rarly, some bugs are intentional.

  **2. Your issue is impossible (or insanely hard) to fix.** It's not worth the effort.

  **3. Your issue has been fixed.**

**If your issue has been closed for any reason, check the [Trello](https://trello.com/invite/b/KwcIRczQ/ATTI1ed7a8a74da118a24cbe1875755402176C1DBAB2/schematic-map-maker) to see if it has been moved to the top of the "Schematic Archive" list. If it has, your bug has been fixed**
