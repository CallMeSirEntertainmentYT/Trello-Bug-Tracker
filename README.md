# Esteemed Interlocutor,

Permit me to extend my cordial salutations. The document you are currently perusing serves as an exhaustive repository for issues pertaining to irregularities, anomalies, and aberrations discovered within the schematics, maps, and modifications I have meticulously crafted and made accessible on my [Trello](https://trello.com/invite/b/KwcIRczQ/ATTI1ed7a8a74da118a24cbe1875755402176C1DBAB2/schematic-map-maker) platform. If you have not yet had the opportunity to peruse this resource, I would strongly urge you to do so posthaste.

## Protocol for Reporting Irregularities
1. I kindly request you to commence the creation of a new issue.
2. It is of utmost importance that all fields deemed mandatory are populated with accurate information.
3. While it is not a requirement, your subscription to my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@callmesirentertainment) would be greatly appreciated and would serve to enhance our mutual engagement.
4. Upon ensuring the accuracy of the information provided, I kindly request you to proceed to submit the issue.

## Explanation for Issue Closure
Should you find that your issue has been closed, it may be due to one of the following reasons:

  1. The irregularity reported is intentional. This is a rare occurrence, but it is important to note that some irregularities are indeed deliberate.
  2. The irregularity reported is either unfeasible to rectify or the rectification process is excessively challenging. In such instances, the effort required may not be commensurate with the potential outcome.
  3. The irregularity reported has been successfully addressed and resolved.

In the event of your issue being closed for any reason, I would recommend perusing the [Trello](https://trello.com/invite/b/KwcIRczQ/ATTI1ed7a8a74da118a24cbe1875755402176C1DBAB2/schematic-map-maker) to ascertain if it has been relocated to the top of the "Schematic Archive" list. If it has, you can be assured that your reported irregularity has been duly addressed and rectified. If you have any further queries or require additional clarification, please do not hesitate to contact me. I am here to assist you to the best of my abilities. Your understanding and cooperation are greatly appreciated. Thank you.
